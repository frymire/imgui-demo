# imgui-demo
Proof that I can use imgui

See: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWXrFetSH8w&list=WL&index=48

Custom application added as Application.h and Application.cpp within example_win32_directx12.

Each run creates or references an imgui.ini file that stores the window settings from the previous run.

To get rid of the extra console window, in Project Properties -> Linker -> System, set SubSystem to "Windows".
